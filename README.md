I would interpret user needs by gathering information by either face to face meetings or written corresspondences from them. Then I would develop these needs by coding on a priority listing from the highest to the lowest. Creating user stories helps us understand what the user wants and what we need to implement into the program. The approach I would take developing programs would be a manangement approach by understanding the processes of code development and applying multiple agile processes, either scrum teams or multiple teams depending on the size of the project.

Having a positive attitude and helping others that are behind or overwhelmed will make you a valuable team member on any team.
